# dotfiles

I'm learning about dotfiles thanks to Patrick Mcdonald.

## TODO
- Terminal Preferences
- Changed Shell to ZSH
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preference (don't rearrange spaces)
- Finder Show Path Bar
- Trackpad (Three Finger Drag and Tap to Click)
- Git (Config and SSH)
- Alfred (turn off Spotlight shortcut and use for alfred)
- Snappy (turn off cmd+shift+4 for screenshots and use for Snappy)
- Remove unwanted apps from mas-cli (within brewfile)
